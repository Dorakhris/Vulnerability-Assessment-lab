# Case Scenario

You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query or request data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability. A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks with decision-makers at the company. You must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.
# System Description

The database server runs on Debian Linux with 2TB of memory and a powerful CPU. It uses IPv4 addresses for network connections and currently employs SSL for encrypted communications.
# Scope

This assessment looks into how people access the server from July to September 2024 following guidelines from NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1.
# Purpose

The database server stores important customer data, campaign information, and analytics used for marketing and business insights. Securing it is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive information.
# Risk Assessment

| Threat Source       | Threat Event                | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|------------|----------|------|
| Hackers             | Stealing sensitive information | High       | High     | 9    |
| Former Employees    | Sharing or selling confidential data | Medium     | High     | 6    |
| Current Employees   | Disrupting operations        | Medium     | High     | 6    |
| Customers           | Unauthorized changes to data | Low        | High     | 3    |
# Approach

We identified potential risks from open access permissions such as data breaches and operational disruptions. High-risk scenarios include reputational damage from leaked customer data and interruptions to business operations.
# Remediation Strategy

- **Access Controls**: Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit who can access what.
- **Authentication**: Add extra checks like multi-factor authentication (MFA) to make sure only authorized people get in.
- **Encryption**: Upgrade from SSL to TLS for safer data transfers.
- **Monitoring**: Keep an eye on who logs in and what they do to catch any problems early.
